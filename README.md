# Xenomai_programs
## Real Time Linux programs
The document gives the RT-Linux programs(using Xenomai) to demonstrate the basic RTOS concepts such as 

1. Task management
2. Priority based preemptive scheduling,
3. Round Robin scheduling,
4. Inter task communication,
5. Inter task synchronization,
6. Priority inversion and its solution.

This work is derived from the works on the website of Radboud University, Nijmegen.

The programs are tested with VirtualBox image given in the above site. 
I hope this document will help someone who wants to learn the RTOS concepts through Linux practically.
